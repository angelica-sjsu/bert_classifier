"Good. It IS a page turner. You can read this book in one day, two at the most, and the plot drives the whole book. The unreliable narrators (there are two besides the main character) are as unlikable as they are unreliable, and there isn't a nice male in the book. Entirely plot driven; the characters are paper thin. You can figure out who-dunnit by the middle of the book. The ending is weak. I can't imagine what all the fuss is about, except that it is quick and there are lots of twists and turns, and you can't trust anyone to tell the truth.",0
"I devoured this book in just a few days, which is rare for me these days, but a sure sign that it was good as I could not put it down. It's got a very Gone Girl-esque feel, and until the last few chapters I was totally in the dark as to how the story was going to end (and I only got an idea as to how it would because I cheated and peeked ahead a few chapters one night). Recommend if you enjoy thrillers and suspense novels!",1
"I bought several books to get through the summer with. For some reason I kept putting this one at the end of the pile.  When I finally took it out,  I thought it was kind of confusing and depressing at that. All I can say is, hang on and keep reading through about the first 60 pages or so or until you just HAVE to know more about what drives these characters!  There is a lot of internal dialogue that goes on that I would think would be completely missed in the film format. You will get to know what makes these characters tick, which in itself is extremely interesting and entertaining. After you get through the first tough beginning and begin to know who's who in the zoo, prepare not to get any sleep until the story ends. This is where it takes off like a locomotive and twists and turns around every bend. Truly a thriller that makes you hold on and gasp for air! By all means, order directly from Amazon NOW!",1
"I can't really see why this is a best seller.  A lot of it just dragged.  Way too many drunken blackouts.  Every character is totally dysfunctional, except for the baby.  The book is just over the top with needy, sick people.  I wouldn't recommend it.  At least I know what all the hype is about; I just don't think the book is worth the hype.",0
"If you liked Gone Girl, you'll love the Girl on the Train. Do you ever really know anyone? You'll ask yourself that question more than once as you read this novel. The character development is intriguing. You hurt for Rachel, feel for Anna, envy Megan. But are things what they really seem? This one is hard to put down..",1
"Disappointing read.  Multiple points of view, but they all sounded so similar to each other.  And all the main characters were so unlikable that the whodunit fun was nearly ruined because you end up kind of not caring who did it.  Shouldn't be likened to Gone Girl,which was a much more compelling story.",0
"I didn't care that much for it.  I didn't like the way it was written in singular persons, every chapter was a different character telling their story.  It did have a twist in the end.  I didn't like reading about all the drinking.",0
"Finally finished. It was a bit confusing at times, jumping from one characters perspective to another until I sorted them out . Main character a bit pitiful.The characters were well written and interesting. At times it did seem to drag on. The ending ties all the pieces together quite well. Main character still a bit pitiful. All in all I enjoyed it.",1
"I struggled to get into this book until the very end, as the shifting between narrators made it more difficult to dig into what any one person was saying/thinking. But there were a lot of interesting turns and twists, and the end was very exciting. So it was an enjoyable read, particularly for a book club book, but not great enough that I didn't wish I was reading the book I was reading on my own until the very end.",0
"It was a real page turner, and I hope the movie is good as well.  Makes you think if you really know yourself and can you trust yourself.  Are your doubts really you, or what people have put upon you?  Also makes you think twice about drinking and even thinking about your ex.",1
