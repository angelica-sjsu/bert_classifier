# bert_classifier

Classify reviews in positive or negative sentiment.

First part: reads the IMDB data set and creates two sets: train and dev.

Second part: creates the feature maps for each reviews.

Third part: trains a shallow fully connected model

Embeddings (feature maps) are not included so the code must be run at least once to create them.
